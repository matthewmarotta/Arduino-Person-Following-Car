* Description:
* This program is designed to give functionality to an arduino car by implementing controls and settings for the components attached including
* a motor, Ultrasonic sensor and an Infrared sensor.
* 
* Intended Use:
* Enable an arduino controlled car to follow a person whilst carrying their personal objects
*
* Equipment:
* -Plastic Chassis
* -DC motors x2
* -Jumper wires
* -2 wheels connected to each motor
* -1 fixed wheel for the front
* -Plastic storage box
* -L298N motor driver
* -Arduino Mega2560 Rev3
* -Grove Ultrasonic distance sensor
* -MLX90614 Infrared sensor
* -9V Battery holder
* 
* How to Run:
* 1. Construct car
* 2. Wire up motor driver to motors
* 3. Wire up motor driver and sensors to arduino and battery holder
* 4. Upload program to arduino
* 5. Switch on arduino (turn off arduino to stop car)
